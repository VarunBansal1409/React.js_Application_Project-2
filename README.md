# React.js_Application_Project
"This React app provides a simple popup form for creating custom segments. Clicking “Save segment” opens a modal where users can enter a segment name and choose schema fields like First Name, Last Name, Gender, Age, Account Name, City, and State. Selected fields can be added with “+Add new schema,” and each added schema appears as its own dropdown showing only the remaining unselected options.

The app uses basic React state management, dynamic dropdown updates, and conditional rendering to handle the segment-building process. When the user clicks “Save the segment,” the app sends the data to the server in the required JSON format containing the segment name and the selected schema list."
