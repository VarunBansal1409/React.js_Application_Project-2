# Save Segment App
"This React application provides a simple and interactive way to create and save a segment using a modal popup. Users can enter a segment name and add multiple schemas dynamically from a dropdown list. Once a schema is added, it appears in a highlighted section and is removed from the available options to prevent duplicate selections.

The application uses React state to manage dynamic dropdowns, form inputs, and conditional rendering. On clicking “Save the segment”, the selected data is formatted into the required JSON structure and sent to the server, demonstrating practical handling of dynamic forms and data submission in React."
